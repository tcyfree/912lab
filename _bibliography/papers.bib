  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {RAID-enabled SSDs commonly have unbalanced I/O workloads on their components (e.g., SSD channels), as the data/parity chunks in the same stripe may have varied access frequency, which greatly impacts I/O responsiveness. This article proposes a I/O scheduling scheme by resorting to the degraded read mode and the read-modify-write mode to reduce the long-tail latency of I/O requests in RAID-enabled SSDs. The basic idea is to avoid scheduling read or update requests to the heavily congested but targeted RAID components. Such requests are satisfied by accessing other relevant RAID components by certain XOR computations (we call the degraded modes). Specially, we build a queuing overhead assessment model on the top of factors of data redundancy and the current blocked I/O traffics on SSD channels to precisely dispatch incoming I/O requests to be fulfilled with the degraded mode or not. The trace-driven experiments illustrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the long-tail latency of read requests by 23.1% on average at the 99.99th percentile, in contrast to state-of-the-art scheduling methods.},
